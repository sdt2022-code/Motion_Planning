# Motion_Planning

In this motion planning problem, we implement (Rapidly exploring Random Tress), i.e., RRT and RRT* in a sampling-based motion planning problem. Path generation is 
subject to kinodynamic constraints. That is, constraints on the possible paths to be taken in terms of minimum turning radius, velocity, and acceleration. 
Known class of kinodynamic constraints are Dubins path problem in which the path is subject to a curvature constraint as well as an initial and final tangential 
vector constraint.
